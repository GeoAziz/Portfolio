      "modelReasoning": "The model enumerated 12 core protocols, grouping them by reliability and power constraints. It then selected the most common protocol from each category to provide a concise and representative answer.",
      "response": "There are numerous protocols for IoT networking, but they can be broadly categorized into several key families. The most prominent include: 1. **MQTT:** A lightweight messaging protocol ideal for low-power devices. 2. **CoAP:** A protocol designed for simple, constrained devices. 3. **HTTP/2:** A more robust protocol for devices with more processing power. 4. **LoRaWAN:** A long-range, low-power protocol for wide-area networks."
