# Building the Systems Journal

This isn't a traditional blog. It's a **living workshop**—a space where we document engineering decisions, failed experiments, and system insights. 

## Technical Foundation

```typescript
// This is how we parse posts
const getPost = async (slug: string) => {
  const file = await fs.readFile(`content/blog/${slug}.mdx`);
  const { data, content } = matter(file);
  return { metadata: data, content };
};
```

### Design Principle
Every technical decision must serve at least one of:

1.  **Clarity** for readers
2.  **Maintainability** for us
3.  **Performance** for users

This post will be updated as we build. That's intentional—systems evolve.
