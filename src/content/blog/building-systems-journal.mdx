## Initializing the Journal

This is the first entry in the Systems Journal. The purpose of this space is to document the engineering process, share insights from system architecture, and explore the intersection of software, hardware, and AI.

The journal itself is built on an MDX-powered stack, allowing for a seamless blend of narrative prose and interactive technical components.
