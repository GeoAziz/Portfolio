## Welcome to the Systems Journal

This is the first entry in what I'm calling a "Systems Journal" or "Field Notes." The purpose is not to be a traditional blog, but rather a living document—a workshop for ideas, experiments, and reflections on the art and science of engineering.

### Why "Systems"?

I believe the most impactful engineers are **systems thinkers**. They don't just see code, circuits, or models in isolation. They see interconnected components, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors. They understand that a change in one part of a system can have non-linear effects elsewhere.

This journal is a space to explore that idea. Expect to find posts covering:

- **Technical Deep Dives:** Exploring a specific algorithm, architecture, or hardware-level optimization.
- **Philosophical Insights:** Reflections on the nature of intelligence, complexity, and the role of the builder in a technological world.
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis:** Connecting ideas from software, AI, hardware, and even biology or physics.

The goal is to build in public, think in public, and learn in public. Welcome to the workshop.
